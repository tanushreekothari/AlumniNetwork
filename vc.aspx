<br /><br />The effects of globalization and recent recession have put tremendous pressure on everybody i.e. industry, business and the education system also. In the last decade, technical institutions have spread in every corner of the country and thus a large number of technical personnel are being produced every year. However, various agencies have carried out surveys which indicate that only 25 percent graduates produced are employable. If the quality of the engineers/managers produced do not match with those produced in other parts of the world, it will be difficult for our graduates to find jobs because today a large number of Indian graduates depend on out-of-the-country MNCs for their jobs.

<br />We, at GLA, have been striving hard in this direction right from inception to produce such professionals (technocrats and managers) as are employable and as a result we have been achieving almost 100% placements i.e. over 70% through campus and rest by students on their own.

<br />Choosing an institution and a branch of study is the key to success. When I talk of the branch, I do not mean a branch where current employability rate is high because it is variable and may be low when you pass out. But what I mean is to choose a branch which is of interest to the particular student. Building future of its students is the leitmotif of GLA University. If you are hardworking and committed to your goals then as the student of GLA University, you will be aptly rewarded with bright future where the University will help you to build your skills-set, knowledge repository and develop your intellectual capital.

<br />The University offers undergraduate courses viz., B Tech, B Pharm, BBA, BCA, B.Sc. Biotechnology and postgraduate courses like, MCA, MBA, M Pharm and M Tech. You will be refined by experienced and energetic faculty-members supported by modern, state-of-the-art resources.</p>
